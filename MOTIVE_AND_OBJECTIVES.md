# Motive and Objectives

## Motive
LifeTrack exists to solve fragmented personal health tracking. Most users split activity, nutrition, vitals, and chronic-condition records across multiple apps or manual logs. This causes low adherence and poor decision quality.

## Problem Statement
- Chronic-condition management needs continuity, trend visibility, and reminders.
- Generic fitness apps lack medical context and structured records.
- Data privacy concerns reduce willingness to log sensitive health data.

## Objectives
- Unify daily wellness and medical records in one offline-first app.
- Improve consistency through reminders and behavior insights.
- Provide interpretable trend views for recovery and risk monitoring.
- Support secure local handling of sensitive health data.
- Keep architecture extensible for sync, clinician workflows, and analytics.

## Non-Goals
- Not a diagnostic or treatment-prescribing system.
- Not a replacement for professional medical care.
