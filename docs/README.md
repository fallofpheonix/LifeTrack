# Documentation

This folder contains **non-runtime material** only (planning, architecture notes, reports, and research).

- **Nothing in `docs/` is required for building or running the app.** The application compiles and runs without any files in this directory.
- **Do not place executable assets here.** This folder is for documentation and reference only—no scripts, binaries, or other runnable assets.
- **This folder is excluded from architectural reasoning.** The app’s architecture and codebase structure are defined in `lib/` and project configuration; `docs/` is not part of that design.
